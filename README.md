# Numerical Analysis and Basic Plots

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for solving numerical analysis problems, including:
- Gaussian elimination
- Interpolation methods (Newton, Lagrange)
- Vector calculus (Gradient, Divergence, Curl)
- Partial differential equations (Heat equation)
- Laplace transforms and inverse transforms

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/Logshi/Numerical_Analysis_and_Basic_Plots.git
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder.
3. Run the `.m` files based on your need (e.g., `gaussian_elimination.m`, `newtons_interpolation.m`).
